I am about to take an important exam on my computer, and want to develop a solution to help me get answers. I want to create a Node.JS desktop app that will run in my taskbar; when I press a shortcut (alt+s) it will take a screenshot of my screen. I should be able to press it and take as many screenshots as possible, and the program should display them in a little UI in the top right of my screen. This UI should only be for visual purposes: it should always stay above my screen, but should never get "selected". Once I accumulate as many screenshots as I want, I should be able to press the next shortcut (alt+a); this will use the Gemini API to prompt `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21` with the screenshot(s), along with a prompt asking to solve/answer whatever is shown. The AI's response should be then shown in my app's UI (still making sure that it is just showing it, never actually have the program be selected/focused). From there, I can either try the request again using the same screenshot(s) by pressing (alt+a), or delete the answer and current screenshot(s) by pressing the shortcut (alt+d).
I want you to fully develop and implement this. Give me the full code for all the needed files. This should be developed in Node.JS, but I later want to export it as an installable program on my computer.
